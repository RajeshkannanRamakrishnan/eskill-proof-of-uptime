One of the key ingredients of a robust network is the uptime of nodes in
the Network. This increases the number of Active Avatars on the network
and the capacity of the Network to take on jobs.

What the `proof-of-uptime` skill does is incentivises avatars for
connecting and supporting the network. Every day a Proof Of Uptime job
task is assigned to each Avatar which they need to perform the same day.

## Payout

Payout amount and the difficulty level is variable and depends on the
EVER balance of the Avatar.

```
<1000 EVER - 0.1 EVER
1000 - 10000 EVER - 0.5 EVER
>10000 - 50000 EVER -  2 EVER
> 50000 EVER - 5 EVER
```

Payout plan.
